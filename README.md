# oil-spills-llm
testing the docling library. I will use the langGraph and langChain libraries

# Domain: oil spill monitoring
The objective is to build a knowledge graph using locally stored pdfs. This use-case can be extended to different kind of documents in a business

# Workflow
- Data Preparation: Extract text from PDFs using Docling
- Embedding and Vector Database: Convert text to embeddings, and store them for retrieval
- RAG pipeline: Build the RAG using LangChain
- Lightweight LLM: Use a Hugging Face Modelthat runs efficiently on your hardware
- Jupyter notebook: For interactivity
